* Better build system.

* Support for verifying that the removal of a node would yield a valid
   structure.

* Support for verifying that the addition of a node would yield a
   valid structure.

* Support for context-invariant validations, which should reduce
   memory usage, help editors be more user friendly and possibly be
   faster generally.

Context Independence
==================

An element is context-independent if the schema does not allow its
structure to vary depending on where it appears in the document being
validated. 

An element E is context-independent relative to another element C which
is its parent or preceding sibling if, given that E is a child of C or
a sibling of C makes it so that E can only have one structure.

Shallow validation: A shallow validation of element E is one which
walks the children nodes of E to ascertain that the structure of E is
correct but assumes that the children of E are internally valid.

A document which contains only context-independent elements can be
validated by shallowly validating all its elements in any order.

A document which contains a mixture of context-independent elements can
be validated as follows:

While there are elements not validated:
  For each not-validated element E:
    If E is context-independent OR E has a definition associated with it:
      For each child node C:
        Check that C fits E's structure but do not descend into C. (Shallow validation of E.)
        If C is not context-independent:
          If C is relatively context-independent:
            Associate C with the definition required by context.
          Else: 
            # Is this possible??? It seems to me that E would 
            # also have to be variant or have no definition associated with it
            # for this to happen. 
      Remove E from the set of non-validated elements
    # Else we skip it   
      
The algorithm above, if correct should empty the set of non-validated
elements. If not, there's an error in the algorithm.

Fake Dependence
===============

<choice>
 <element name="person">
  <attribute name="first-name"/>
  <attribute name="last-name"/>
 </element>
 <element name="person">
  <element name="first-name"><text/></element>
  <element name="last-name"><text/></element>
 </element>
</choice>

I call the pattern above fake variance because it is equivalent to:

<element name="person">
 <choice>
  <group>
   <attribute name="first-name"/>
   <attribute name="last-name"/>
  </group>
  <group>
   <element name="first-name"><text/></element>
   <element name="last-name"><text/></element>
  </group>
 </choice>
</element>

The choice is not really between two differently structured "person"
elements but between two contents for "person".



* Support for events that are more appropriate in a DOM
   environment. For instance, have a whole start tag be treated as a
   single event, with attributes and all, rather than a series of
   "enterStartTag", "attributeName", "attributeValue", "leaveStartTag"
   events.

* Dump xml_path as variable.
  * Add a Start class to validate deriving from Pattern which will
   hold the start pattern. (Instead of the current system in which
   there is no Pattern corresponding to <start>.
  * Make xml_path be computed dynamically by joining the path
   information of a given element with the path information of its
   parent. (Cache it for performance.)
  * Since this is a variable used for debugging, then the cost of
   computing these will be born during debugging but not otherwise.

* Handle the util.inspect replacement better.
